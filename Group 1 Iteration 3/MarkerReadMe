1. We have implemented up to the end of the first round. There is still no starting tile for any player and no AI functionality has been built. Please do 
 not select any AI during game setup as these players will not be created and it will break this minor release.

2. Some buttons in the game do not have any functionality, and others are missing some functionality to ensure proper use.

3. The colourConfiguration.txt file must live in the same folder as the jar/java files.

4. Run the KingDomino.jar file via commandline interpreter (console/terminal) with command 'java -jar KingDomino.jar' (without the quotes)
If the jar file does not execute for some reason, download all .java files and the colourConfiguration.txt file into the same folder. Via a console/terminal
use the command 'javac *.java' (without quotes) and then use 'java Driver' (without quotes).
