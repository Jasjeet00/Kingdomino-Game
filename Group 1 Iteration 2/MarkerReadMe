1. We have functionality living in the UI in order to get one of the use case descriptions working. That functionality will be migrated over to the 
application level for next iteration.

2. The game will display a basic non-functional game board after progressing through the game set-up process. The game board is not a requirement of this
iteration.

3. The colourConfiguration.txt file must live in the same folder as the jar/java files.

4. Run the KingDomino.jar file via commandline interpreter (console/terminal) with command 'java -jar KingDomino.jar' (without the quotes)
If the jar file does not execute for some reason, download all .java files and the colourConfiguration.txt file into the same folder. Via a console/terminal
use the command 'javac *.java' (without quotes) and then use 'java Driver' (without quotes).
